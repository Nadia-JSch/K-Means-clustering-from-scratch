# K-Means-clustering-from-scratch
 An unsupervised machine learning algorithim to form a k number of clusters over a user-specified number of iterations.

## Description

For a more detailed explanation, checkout my [blog post](https://gearsofdevthoughts.wordpress.com/2022/06/28/k-means-clustering-the-long-way/).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The three .csv files in this repository are needed. They are: 
* data1953.csv
* data2008.csv
* dataBoth.csv

Import the following libraries:
* numpy
* csv
* matplotlib

### Installing

Runs on any Python IDE with the .csv files in the same folder as kmeans.py.

### Executing program

Follow the prompts and enter the following:
* Enter number corresponding to the data set to use (1, 2 or 3)
* Enter the value of k - a number between 2 and 5 (inclusive) 
* Enter the number of iterations to perform. Ideally between 4 and 8.
